Journey of cloning of the web Unsplash.com
In the construct week of unit-2, we were assigned to clone the website https://unsplash.com/.
And this blog is all about how I completed project in 6 days, what challenges did I face? , How do I tackle them?, What are the things I used to achieve our goals?.
Tech and Stack we used:
HTML
CSS
Java script
Git
Website Snippets:






Challenges:
.The approach of the project was that I saw that is a navbar that was attached to the homepage. So that we have dived the project into parts.
. Another problem was to merge all of the files in a proper sequence which was again a difficult task for us because while merging and connecting all the pages some of the pages had the same name, and while running the site it was redirecting to some other pages so it was difficult too.
Responsiveness:
We used the desktop-first approach and we created the website for all-size Media Queries.
Conclusion:
I would like to thank all my mentors Chandra Shekar sir, Nrupul sir for teaching the topics very good. Iâ€™m also very fortunate for being a part of Masai School.
